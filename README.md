# FreeToPlay-Champs
A GUI tool in python's built-in tkinter module for displaying this week's Free To Play champions in League Of Legends.

I'd recommend putting this Python into a repsitory by itself. 
The program downloads images on the fly and stores them in the same directory.

Also, you'll need to write your own Riot Games API key into the file to make it work. 
The spot to do so is clearly marked with a comment, and without doing so, the program will not run.

If you don't have one, you can make an account at https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index, 
and then your key can be found at https://developer.riotgames.com/api-keys.html
